scan .NET projects in CLI
ensure order to scan a .NET project, 
ensure the project is built before the Snyk scan takes place.

Additionally,

consult run snyk help to view unique .

whicharameters, 
which support complex projects as well.

instance:

dotnet build proj/myexample.csproj
snyk test --file=proj/myexample.sln
This is particularly important to do

 when using Snyk in a CI/CD environment 
 
 
 because the scan completes locally but

 not in a pipeline test.

Note: Snyk does not support the ".net website" 
type of .net application. This is different from Snyk 
"webapplications" and is missing some key files we require.

See .NET for Snyk for more information.
