# Serverless Framework - An Introduction

**_Build applications that demand attention, not maintenance._**

In 2014, AWS Lambda introduced a shift towards low-maintenance cloud computing. Following closely, the Serverless Framework not only encouraged this new direction by pioneering the concept of "serverless architectures". It simplified the integration of AWS Lambda and other cloud services, enabling developers to create applications that auto-scale, cost nothing when idle, and boast incredibly low maintenance.

Since its inception, the Serverless Framework has been widely embraced by both start-ups and Fortune 500 companies like the New York Times, Nike, and EA Games. Several start-ups have achieved unicorn valuations and substantial exits with remarkably small engineering teams empowered by the Framework's capabilities.

If you want to stay ahead in today's fast-paced world, the Serverless Framework offers a compelling advantage. Build more, manage less, and focus on delivering meaningful innovation.

## Highlights

- **Empowerment for All:** Innovate faster by spending less time on infrastructure management.
- **Maximum Versatility:** Tackle diverse serverless use cases, from APIs and scheduled tasks to web sockets and data pipelines.
- **Automated Deployment:** Streamline development with code and infrastructure deployment handled together.
- **Ease of Use:** Deploy complex applications without deep cloud infrastructure expertise, thanks to simple YAML configuration.
- **Language Agnostic:** Build in your preferred language â€“ Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, or F#.
- **Complete Lifecycle Management:** Build, deploy, monitor, update, and troubleshoot serverless applications with ease.
- **Scalable Organization:** Structure large projects and teams efficiently with multi-domain support.
- **Effortless Environments:** Seamlessly manage development, staging, and production environments.
- **Customization Ready:** Extend and modify the Framework's functionality with a rich plugin ecosystem.
- **Vibrant Community:** Get support and connect with a passionate community of Serverless developers.
