## Running in DEBUG mode
If you run into issues/errors while working with Serverless, we print a user-friendly error. However, when reporting bugs, it's often useful to output the stack trace and other important information. To set debug mode, make sure you set the environment variable `SLS_DEBUG` with the following command (if you're in Unix based system):

```
export SLS_DEBUG=*
```
