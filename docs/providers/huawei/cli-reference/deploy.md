# Huawei Cloud - Deploy

The `serverless deploy` command deploys your entire service via the Huawei Cloud API. Run this command when you have made service changes (i.e., you edited `serverless.yml`).

```bash
serverless deploy
```

## Artifacts

After the `serverless deploy` command runs all created deployment artifacts are placed in the `.serverless` folder of the service.
