# Branch Deployments

Branch deployments enable you to automatically deploy a service to a stage from a branch in your Github repository. Every commit to this branch is automatically deployed.

## Adding a branch deployment

To add a new branch deployment, in the "branch deploys" section of the CI/CD settings, select the Github branch containing the `serverless.yml` from the "source branch" column for each "target stage". Commits from the "source branch" will automatically be deployed to the "target stage".

## Add a stage to a branch deployment

You can assign a stage to each branch deployment, but ensure that a valid provider is set for this service.
