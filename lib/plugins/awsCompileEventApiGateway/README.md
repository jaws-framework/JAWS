# Compile Api Gateway Events

This plugins compiles the functions HTTP endpoint definitions to valid API Gateway CloudFormation resources.

## How it works

`Compile Api Gateway Events` hooks into the [`deploy:compileEvents`](/lib/plugins/deploy) lifecycle.

It loops over all functions which are defined in `serverless.yaml`. For each function that has a `http` event
defined, an API Gateway REST API will be created.

Furthermore a lambda permission for the current function is created which makes is possible to invoke the function when
the endpoint is accessed.

Take a look at the [Event syntax examples](#event-syntax-examples) below to see how you can setup HTTP events.

Those resources are then merged into the `serverless.service.resources.Resources` section.

## Universal JSON request template

The API Gateway plugin implements a request template which provides `{body, method, headers, query, path, identity,
stageVariables} = event` as JavaScript objects. This way you don't have to define the template on your own but can use
this default template to access the necessary variables in your code.

## Event syntax examples

### Simple http setup

This setup specifies that the `index` function should be run when someone accesses the API gateway at `users/index` via
a `GET` request.

```yaml
# serverless.yaml
functions:
    index:
        handler: users.index
        events:
            - http: GET users/index
```

### Http setup with extended event options

Here we've defined an POST endpoint for the path `posts/create`.

```yaml
# serverless.yaml
functions:
    create:
        handler: posts.create
        events:
            - http:
                path: posts/create
                method: post
```
